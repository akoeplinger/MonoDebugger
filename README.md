UNMAINTAINED
============

**This was originally a fork of https://github.com/giessweinapps/MonoDebugger but that repository was deleted, so GitHub made my fork the authoritative source. I'm not affiliated with the repository and I don't maintain it, but I'll keep it around in case some people find the code useful (remember to check the LICENSE).**
